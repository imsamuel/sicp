; Modify the timed-prime-test procedure of Exercise 1.22 to use fast-prime?
; (the Fermat method), and test each of the 12 primes you found in that
; exercise. Since the Fermat test has Î˜(logn) growth, how would you expect the
; time to test primes near 1,000,000 to compare with the time needed to test
; primes near 1000? Do your data bear this out? Can you explain any discrepancy
; you find?
